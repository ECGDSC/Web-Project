## Git Commands

### Pushing Your Changes to Git

When you worked on some part of the project, say you edited <code>floor_2.html</code> and you want your team member to be able to access it, you can push your code and make it accessible to everyone. Here is a step-by-step guide for that:

1. Navigate to the directory where the file you want to push is in. In this case, <code>floor_2.html</code> is in the folder/directory <code>floor2</code> in <code>Web-Project</code> and let's say you are currently in the main directory, <code>Web-Project</code>, you woud use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to <code>floor2</code>. You use the command <code>cd floor2</code>, which leads you to the desired directory.
Note: use <code>cd ..</code> to go back a directory.

2. Now, you use the command `git add` and the name of the file/files (with spaces between multiple file names) to add the file you edited.  For example:
    
  ```ruby
  C:\Users\parsa\OneDrive\Desktop\GDSC\Web-Project\floor2> git add floor2.html
  ```
    
3. Then use <code>git commit -m “SOME COMMENT”</code> writing a comment on what you did with the file you are pushing in the “some comments” portion (remember the quotes). 
4. Finally, run the command <code>git push</code> to push the changes.

Now, your friend or anyone else who cloned Web-Project can pull your changes using the command <code>git pull</code>.
