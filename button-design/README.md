# Make Your Buttons More Interesting!

The HTML and CSS files are examples of how you can add more designs to your buttons on every floor.

The style.css file is like the CSS files on every floor. Those don't need to be modified.

## Group working on the design:

Create a new CSS file like the button-style.css one, and add all the design elements you like in separate classes (don't forget comments describing the design).

## Every Group:

To make sure every floor has the same type of design:

* Copy the design CSS file to your floor's directory.
* Add a reference link to the CSS file in your floor's HTML file (as shown in the button.html file)
* Check out the CSS file and determine which design elements to add to each button and add that class name to the buttons in your HTML file.
